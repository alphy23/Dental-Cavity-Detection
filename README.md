The project aims to enhance oral health by early detection of dental cavities using deep learning, specifically the U-Net architecture. This technology utilizes annotated grayscale images to train a model that accurately identifies cavities from dental X-rays and normal images. The system offers a user-friendly interface for easy accessibility, emphasizing proactive dental care through advanced cavity detection techniques.
